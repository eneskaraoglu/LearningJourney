# React Basics - Sample Project

This is a working React application demonstrating the concepts from Module 01.

## What's Demonstrated

- **Components**: Reusable UI building blocks
- **Props**: Passing data to components
- **JSX**: HTML-like syntax in JavaScript
- **Conditional Rendering**: Showing content based on conditions
- **List Rendering**: Displaying arrays of data
- **Event Handling**: Responding to user interactions

## Getting Started

1. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

2. Start the development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

3. Open your browser to the URL shown (usually http://localhost:5173)

## Project Structure

```
sample/
├── src/
│   ├── App.jsx      # Main component with all examples
│   ├── main.jsx     # React entry point
│   └── styles.css   # Styling
├── index.html       # HTML template
├── package.json     # Dependencies
└── vite.config.js   # Vite configuration
```

## Try It Yourself

- Modify the sample data in App.jsx
- Add new components
- Experiment with different props
- Try different styling approaches

## Next Steps

After understanding these basics, move on to Module 02 to learn about component composition and more advanced patterns.
