/**
 * Observability and Capstone Implementation - Extended Exercises
 *
 * Goal: Build production-style habits while practicing module concepts.
 * Rule: Complete tasks in order. Do not open 03-solutions.js until done.
 */

// Part A - Logging and Correlation
// 1. Create request logger middleware outputting JSON logs.
// 2. Attach or generate request ID and include in response header.
// 3. Log method, path, status, durationMs for every request.

// Part B - Metrics and Alerts
// 1. Track counters for success and error responses.
// 2. Track latency histogram buckets (simple buckets are fine).
// 3. Expose `/metrics` endpoint with current values.

// Part C - Capstone Plan
// 1. Write final project scope: modules, endpoints, and data model.
// 2. Define non-functional requirements: auth, tests, logs, deployment.
// 3. Create delivery checklist with milestones and risk notes.

// Constraints
// - Use clear function names and small functions.
// - Add explicit input validation where relevant.
// - Keep error messages user-friendly and debuggable.

// Acceptance Criteria
// - Logs are structured and include correlation ID.
// - Metrics reflect real request outcomes.
// - Capstone scope is realistic and testable.

// Bonus Challenge
// - Add lightweight load test script and capture baseline metrics.
// - Write incident runbook for one simulated production failure.

// Reflection Prompts
// 1. Which part was hardest and why?
// 2. What bug did you hit and how did you debug it?
// 3. What would you refactor before shipping this?

// TODO: Implement your solution below.
