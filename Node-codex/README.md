# Node.js Curriculum (Codex)

This track is a full Node.js learning path from fundamentals to production architecture.

## Structure
- `01-beginner/`: core JavaScript-for-backend, Node runtime, Express, REST basics
- `02-mid/`: auth, databases, testing, security and deployment habits
- `03-senior/`: architecture, async systems, observability, and capstone design

Each module has:
- `01-...-lesson.md`
- `02-exercises.js`
- `03-solutions.js`

## Study Flow
1. Read the lesson file and run small examples.
2. Complete `02-exercises.js` without looking at solutions.
3. Compare with `03-solutions.js` and refactor your approach.
4. Build one mini feature after every module.

## Suggested Pace
- 4 to 6 sessions per week
- 60 to 90 minutes per session
- Build and ship a mini API after each phase
