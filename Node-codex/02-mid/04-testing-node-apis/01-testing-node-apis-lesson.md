# Testing Node APIs (Vitest + Supertest)

    ## Goals
    - Write reliable unit and API integration tests with deterministic assertions.
    - Practice implementation patterns used in real Node.js projects.
    - Build confidence for interviews and project work.

    ## Core Concepts
    - Unit tests validate pure functions quickly.
- Integration tests verify route contracts.
- Use arrange-act-assert structure.
- Mock external dependencies for repeatable tests.

    ## Practice Tasks
    1. Write unit test for calculateTotal(items).
1. Create simple Express route GET /ping.
1. Write Supertest assertion for status and body.
1. Add failing test for missing field in POST body.

    ## Interview Focus
    - Explain tradeoffs of this module's approach versus simpler alternatives.
    - Describe typical failure modes and how to debug them.
    - Show how you would test or monitor this area in production.

    ## Quick Prompt
    Implement a mini feature that uses all concepts above, then refactor once for readability and once for reliability.
