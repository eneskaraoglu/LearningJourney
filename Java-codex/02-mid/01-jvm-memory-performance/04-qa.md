# Q&A

Q: Heap vs stack?
A: Heap stores objects; stack stores method frames and local variables.

Q: What causes long GC pauses?
A: Large heaps, poor tuning, or GC algorithms not suited to workload.

Q: What is JIT compilation?
A: The JVM compiles hot bytecode into native code for speed.

Q: How do memory leaks happen in Java?
A: Objects remain referenced and cannot be collected.

Q: What is a thread dump used for?
A: Inspecting thread states, deadlocks, and blocking calls.

Q: What is allocation rate?
A: How fast new objects are created, impacting GC pressure.

Q: Why is benchmarking tricky on the JVM?
A: Warm-up, JIT, and GC effects can distort results.

Q: What is escape analysis?
A: The JVM optimizes objects that do not escape a method.
