# Sample Practice - Concurrency Advanced

## Goal
Apply the `Concurrency Advanced` module in runnable code using the track-level sample project.

## Use This Sample Project
- Path: `../../sample-spring-boot-gradle`

## Practice Steps
1. Open the sample project and run it.
2. Implement one feature that directly uses `Concurrency Advanced` concepts.
3. Add one failure-path test and one success-path test.
4. Document your design decisions and tradeoffs.

## Done Criteria
- Feature works in local run.
- Validation and error handling are explicit.
- You can explain how this module concept appears in real production code.
