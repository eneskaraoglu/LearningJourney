# Observability And Deployment

## Goals
- Instrument services with logs, metrics, and traces.
- Use Spring Boot Actuator for health checks.
- Deploy services reliably with basic containerization.

## Core Concepts
Observability includes structured logs, metrics, and traces. Use correlation IDs to connect logs across services. Spring Boot Actuator exposes health, metrics, and info endpoints. For deployment, build container images, use environment variables for config, and define readiness/liveness probes.

## Interview Focus
- Difference between logs, metrics, and traces
- Health checks and graceful shutdown
- Why structured logging matters
- Basic deployment checklist
