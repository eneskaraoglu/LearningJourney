# Solutions (Short)

1. Use `Files.readAllLines(Path)` and loops to count.
2. Split lines by comma, map to `User`, and handle bad rows.
3. Extend `RuntimeException` or `Exception` based on use case.
4. Use `Files.copy(source, target, REPLACE_EXISTING)`.
5. Wrap parsing in `try/catch` and return `Optional<Integer>`.
6. Log the path and error, then throw a custom exception.
