# Q&A

Q: What is the difference between checked and unchecked exceptions?
A: Checked must be declared or handled; unchecked are runtime exceptions.

Q: When should you create a custom exception?
A: When you need domain-specific failure signals with context.

Q: Why use try-with-resources?
A: It automatically closes resources even when exceptions occur.

Q: Should you catch `Exception` broadly?
A: Avoid unless you rethrow or translate with proper logging.

Q: `File` vs `Path`?
A: `Path` is the modern NIO API and is preferred.

Q: What is exception chaining?
A: Wrapping a lower-level exception as the cause of a higher-level one.

Q: Why avoid empty `catch` blocks?
A: They hide failures and make debugging difficult.

Q: What is the cost of reading large files into memory?
A: It can cause memory pressure; stream instead when large.
