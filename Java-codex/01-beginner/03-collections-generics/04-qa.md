# Q&A

Q: Difference between `ArrayList` and `LinkedList`?
A: `ArrayList` has fast random access; `LinkedList` has slower access but cheaper inserts at known nodes.

Q: Why does `HashMap` need `hashCode`?
A: It uses hash buckets to find keys quickly.

Q: When do you use `TreeMap`?
A: When keys must be kept in sorted order.

Q: What are generics for?
A: Type safety and fewer casts at runtime.

Q: What is a wildcard in generics?
A: A flexible type parameter like `? extends Number`.

Q: `List` vs `Set`?
A: `List` allows duplicates and keeps order; `Set` enforces uniqueness.

Q: What is the cost of `contains` on a list?
A: O(n) for `ArrayList` and `LinkedList`.

Q: When does a `HashSet` degrade?
A: With poor hash codes or many collisions.
