# Solutions (Short)

1. Use private fields and validate `withdraw` against current balance.
2. Define `start()` and `stop()` in the interface and implement in each class.
3. Use `abstract double area()` in base, implement in subclasses.
4. Compare by `id` or `email`, then match `hashCode` with the same fields.
5. Inject a `Formatter` and `OutputTarget` into `ReportPrinter`.
6. Make fields `final`, no setters, validate in constructor.
