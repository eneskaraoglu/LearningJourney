# OOP And Design Fundamentals

## Goals
- Build classes with constructors, fields, and methods.
- Explain encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism.
- Use interfaces and understand composition vs inheritance.

## Core Concepts
Encapsulation keeps fields private and exposes behavior through methods. Inheritance models an "is-a" relationship, while composition models a "has-a" relationship and is usually more flexible. Interfaces define contracts and enable polymorphism. Override `equals`, `hashCode`, and `toString` when objects will be compared, stored in hash collections, or logged.

## Interview Focus
- When to choose composition over inheritance
- Abstract class vs interface
- Why override `equals` and `hashCode` together
- Liskov Substitution and basic SOLID principles
