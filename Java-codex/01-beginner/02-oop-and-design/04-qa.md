# Q&A

Q: Difference between abstract class and interface?
A: Abstract classes can hold state and partial implementation; interfaces define contracts and allow multiple inheritance of type.

Q: Why override `hashCode` when `equals` is overridden?
A: Hash-based collections require consistent equality and hashing.

Q: What is polymorphism?
A: Treating objects by their interface or base type while calling overridden behavior.

Q: Composition vs inheritance?
A: Composition is flexible and avoids tight coupling to base class behavior.

Q: What is encapsulation?
A: Hiding internal state and exposing controlled behavior.

Q: What is the Liskov Substitution Principle?
A: Subtypes should be usable wherever base types are expected without breaking behavior.

Q: Why use interfaces in Java?
A: To define stable contracts and enable dependency inversion.

Q: What is an immutable object?
A: An object whose state cannot change after construction.
