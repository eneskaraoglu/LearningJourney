# Q&A

Q: What does `JpaRepository` provide?
A: CRUD, pagination, sorting, and query derivation.

Q: What is the N+1 problem?
A: Loading a list of entities and then loading each relation in separate queries.

Q: Lazy vs eager loading?
A: Lazy loads when accessed; eager loads immediately.

Q: Why use `@Transactional`?
A: To ensure a consistent unit of work with commit or rollback.

Q: What is entity identity?
A: JPA treats the same entity instance per persistence context by ID.

Q: When to use JPQL?
A: For complex queries not expressible by method names.

Q: What is a persistence context?
A: The first-level cache and unit of work for JPA entities.

A: It couples the API to persistence and can cause lazy loading issues.
