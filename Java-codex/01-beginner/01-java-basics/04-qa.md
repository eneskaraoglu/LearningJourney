# Q&A

Q: What is the difference between JDK, JRE, and JVM?
A: JDK includes tools like `javac`, JRE is the runtime, JVM executes bytecode.

Q: Why is `String` immutable?
A: Safety, caching, and performance reasons like string pooling.

Q: When should you use `StringBuilder`?
A: When concatenating in loops to avoid many intermediate strings.

Q: What is autoboxing?
A: Automatic conversion between primitives and wrappers, like `int` to `Integer`.

Q: `==` vs `equals`?
A: `==` compares references; `equals` compares content unless overridden.

Q: What is the classpath?
A: The locations where the JVM looks for classes at runtime.

Q: Why is `main` static?
A: The JVM needs to call it without creating an instance.

Q: What does `public` on `main` do?
A: Allows the JVM to access it from outside the class.
