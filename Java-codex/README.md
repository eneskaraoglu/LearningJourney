# Java Codex

Java Codex is a three-tier, interview-focused Java + Spring track. Each module contains lessons, exercises, solutions, and a focused Q&A bank.

## Structure
- `01-beginner/` fundamentals and Spring Boot entry points.
- `02-mid/` production-ready topics: testing, transactions, security, and ops.
- `03-senior/` architecture, distributed systems, and system design interviews.

Module layout:
- `01-*-lesson.md` theory and examples
- `02-exercises.md` practice tasks
- `03-solutions.md` reference solutions and hints
- `04-qa.md` interview Q&A

Tier extras:
- `00-deep-exercises.md` deeper, project-style tasks
- `00-flashcards.md` rapid Q&A review

Sample project:
- `sample-spring-boot/` REST + JPA + validation + tests
- `sample-spring-boot-secured/` JWT auth + roles
- `sample-spring-boot-gradle/` Gradle variant of the sample

## How To Use
1. Read `01-*-lesson.md` and take notes.
2. Complete `02-exercises.md` without looking at solutions.
3. Check `03-solutions.md` for gaps and compare approaches.
4. Drill `04-qa.md` to sharpen interview responses.
5. Use `00-deep-exercises.md` for hands-on practice.
6. Use `00-flashcards.md` for rapid review.
