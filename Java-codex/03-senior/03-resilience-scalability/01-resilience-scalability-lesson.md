# Resilience And Scalability

## Goals
- Design for failure and graceful degradation.
- Apply rate limiting, bulkheads, and backpressure.
- Plan capacity with clear SLIs and SLOs.

## Core Concepts
Resilience patterns prevent cascading failures. Use timeouts, retries with jitter, and circuit breakers. Bulkheads limit resource usage per subsystem. Rate limiting protects services from abuse. Scalability requires understanding traffic patterns and performance bottlenecks.

## Interview Focus
- Difference between resilience and scalability
- Rate limiting strategies
- Backpressure and queue management
- SLO-driven capacity planning
