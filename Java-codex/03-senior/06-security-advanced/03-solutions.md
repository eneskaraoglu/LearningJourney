# Solutions (Short)

1. Client gets code, exchanges with code verifier, receives tokens.
2. JWT is self-contained; opaque requires introspection.
3. Issue certificates, enforce mutual auth at gateway and services.
4. Identify assets, threats, and mitigations like rate limiting.
5. Rotate in secrets manager, deploy new config, revoke old.
6. Injection and broken access control are common risks.
