# Microservices With Spring Cloud

## Goals
- Apply service discovery and centralized config.
- Use API gateways and client-side load balancing.
- Understand service-to-service communication patterns.

## Core Concepts
Spring Cloud provides building blocks like config server, service discovery, and gateway. Use centralized configuration to manage multiple services. Apply circuit breakers and timeouts to protect dependencies. Use contract testing to avoid breaking changes between services.

## Interview Focus
- When microservices are appropriate
- API gateway responsibilities
- Config server and dynamic refresh
- Circuit breakers and fallback strategies
