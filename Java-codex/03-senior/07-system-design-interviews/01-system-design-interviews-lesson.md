# System Design Interviews

## Goals
- Structure system design discussions clearly.
- Define requirements, constraints, and tradeoffs.
- Produce a scalable architecture with clear components.

## Core Concepts
Start with requirements and scale estimates. Define APIs and data model early. Choose storage based on access patterns. Address caching, messaging, and consistency. Close with reliability, monitoring, and cost tradeoffs. Keep the solution tied to business needs.

## Interview Focus
- Requirement clarification and scope
- Data modeling and API design
- Scaling and reliability strategies
- Identifying tradeoffs explicitly
