# Architecture And DDD

## Goals
- Apply clean architecture and bounded contexts.
- Design aggregates and domain services.
- Avoid anemic domain models.

## Core Concepts
DDD organizes software around business capabilities. Bounded contexts separate models to avoid inconsistent language and rules. Aggregates enforce invariants and define transactional boundaries. Clean architecture keeps domain logic independent from frameworks and infrastructure.

## Interview Focus
- Aggregate boundaries and invariants
- Hexagonal vs layered architecture
- Domain events and application services
- How to avoid framework leakage into core logic
